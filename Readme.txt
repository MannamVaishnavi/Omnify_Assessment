=> Omnify Assessment Project

This project is a simple Flask-based application that simulates a class booking system. It uses Python, Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy to store and manage data, and returns responses in JSON format via REST APIs.

Features
- View available classes
- Book a class
- View all bookings
- Simple in-memory storage (data is reset when the server restarts)

Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended to isolate dependencies)

Setup Instructions
1. Create a folder for the project on your local machine (explaining the way I created). Since the project doesnâ€™t involve multiple collaborators, you can complete the entire work locally and make a single push to GitHub at the end.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional by I recommend) - python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:   venv\Scripts\activate

5. Start the Flask application: python app.py

You will see like this -
